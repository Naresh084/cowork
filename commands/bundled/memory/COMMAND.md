I'll help you manage your long-term memories. Memories persist across conversations and help me remember your preferences, learnings, and project context.

## What would you like to do?

**List memories**: Say "list all memories" or "show memories in preferences"

**Add a memory**: Say "remember that I prefer TypeScript with strict mode" or "add a learning about our API patterns"

**Search memories**: Say "find memories about React" or "search for authentication"

**Remove a memory**: Say "forget the memory about old API" or "delete memory [id]"

**Show memory details**: Say "show memory [id]" or "what do you remember about coding style"

## Memory Groups
- **preferences/** - Your coding style, tool preferences, and personal choices
- **learnings/** - Patterns, insights, and things learned from past sessions
- **context/** - Project architecture decisions and important context
- **instructions/** - Custom guidelines for how I should behave

## Examples
- "Remember that I prefer functional components over class components"
- "List all my preferences"
- "What do you know about this project's architecture?"
- "Forget the outdated API documentation memory"

What would you like me to help you with?
