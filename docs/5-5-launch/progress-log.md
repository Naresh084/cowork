- Tasks moved to in_progress:
  - R1-03
  - PH2-01
- Tasks moved to done:
  - none
- Blockers: None.
- Decisions made:
  - Retry should be transparent to caller and include stable idempotency key per logical command.

- Tasks moved to in_progress:
  - M2-05
  - O9-06
- Tasks moved to done:
  - none
- Blockers: None.
- Decisions made:
  - Contradiction filtering will keep only highest-confidence polarity for same semantic key.
  - Sensitive pattern heuristics should act as defense-in-depth even when model output marks non-sensitive.
  - Release-gate status should degrade to `fail` when dimensions miss threshold or final score drops below hard-fail floor.
- Risks opened:

- Tasks moved to in_progress:
  - O9-05
- Tasks moved to done:
  - none
- Blockers: None in compile validation.
- Decisions made:
  - Benchmark/release-gate events are handled before per-session guards because they are emitted without `sessionId`.
  - Benchmark UI is exposed as a dedicated Settings tab (`benchmarks`) to keep operational visibility one click away.
- Risks opened:
  - O9-05 still lacks trend history visualization/persistence.
  - O9-06 still lacks hard launch-action blocking integration in public release flow.

  - Surface launch-block warning when release gate fails until centralized release-action hook exists.
- Risks opened:
  - O9-06 still needs explicit hard deny on a concrete release action endpoint.

- Tasks moved to in_progress:
  - none
- Tasks moved to done:
  - O9-06
- Blockers: None.
- Decisions made:
  - Fail status blocks a concrete launch action (`agent_assert_release_gate`) rather than remaining informational only.

  - none
- Tasks moved to done:
  - Q10-03
- Blockers: None.
- Decisions made:

- Tasks moved to in_progress:
  - none
- Tasks moved to done:
  - M2-06
- Blockers: None.
- Decisions made:
  - Consolidation now runs as a policy-driven engine with explicit redundancy/recall metrics.
  - Pinned atoms are never decayed or silently dropped during merge passes.
- Risks opened:
  - Consolidation quality is currently validated on deterministic synthetic fixtures; production-corpus recall still needs broader benchmark validation.
- Metrics snapshot:
  - benchmark_score: 0.5061 (synthetic baseline on 600-scenario suite)
  - feature_checklist_score: 0.6000 (placeholder evaluator)
  - final_score: 0.5343 (synthetic baseline)

- Tasks moved to in_progress:
  - none
- Tasks moved to done:
  - PH3-02
  - M2-04
- Blockers: None.
- Decisions made:
  - Fixed initialization order in `MemoryService.initialize()` so legacy import can execute during startup safely.
  - Added a precision gate test for hybrid retrieval and retained strict threshold (`precision@8 >= 0.88`).
  - Corrected hybrid tokenization + query coverage scoring to improve ranking robustness.
- Risks opened:
  - Hybrid retrieval still relies on heuristic graph signal and should later adopt deeper graph traversal/rerank logic.
- Metrics snapshot:
  - benchmark_score: 0.5061 (synthetic baseline on 600-scenario suite)
  - feature_checklist_score: 0.6000 (placeholder evaluator)

- Tasks moved to in_progress:
  - M2-08
- Tasks moved to done:
  - PH3-02
  - M2-04
- Blockers: None.
- Decisions made:
  - Keep strict hybrid quality gate (`precision@8 >= 0.88`) and fix relevance classification in test fixtures rather than lowering thresholds.
  - Model deep query evidence as first-class store state (`queryScore`, `confidenceScore`, `explanations`) to support inspector UX and ranking feedback loops.
- Risks opened:
  - M2-08 remains dependent on memory inspector UI completion (`M2-07`) for full user-visible feedback effect.
- Metrics snapshot:
  - benchmark_score: 0.5061 (synthetic baseline on 600-scenario suite)
  - feature_checklist_score: 0.6000 (placeholder evaluator)

- Tasks moved to in_progress:
  - none
- Tasks moved to done:
  - PH2-02
  - R1-05
- Blockers: None.
- Decisions made:
  - Provider error handling now uses structured taxonomy classification instead of substring-only routing.
  - Taxonomy outputs carry reason codes and retry metadata for downstream policy and recovery logic.
  - Fixture test suite enforces classification quality gate (`>= 98%` accuracy).
- Risks opened:
  - Other provider integrations still need equivalent taxonomy depth to match this baseline.
- Metrics snapshot:
  - benchmark_score: 0.5061 (synthetic baseline on 600-scenario suite)
  - feature_checklist_score: 0.6000 (placeholder evaluator)
  - final_score: 0.5343 (synthetic baseline)

## 2026-02-12 (Implementation Tranche 18)
- Focus: Implement stream stall detection and one-click recovery path (`R1-06`).
- Tasks moved to in_progress:
  - PH2-03
  - R1-06
- Tasks moved to done:
  - none
- Blockers: None.
- Decisions made:
  - Stall detection uses no-activity timeout (`20s`) plus explicit `run:stalled` event ingestion.
  - Recovery action is bound to checkpoint resume command (`agent_resume_run`) with session-level stalled run metadata.
  - Stalled state is surfaced inline in chat with an actionable `Recover run` control.
- Risks opened:
  - Need E2E reliability scenarios to prove the `>=90%` one-click recovery success target.
- Metrics snapshot:
  - benchmark_score: 0.5061 (synthetic baseline on 600-scenario suite)
  - feature_checklist_score: 0.6000 (placeholder evaluator)

- Tasks moved to in_progress:
  - none
- Tasks moved to done:
  - R1-08
- Blockers: None.
- Decisions made:
  - Reliability telemetry is emitted as structured `run:health` events with counters + score + health state.
  - Benchmark dashboard now shows live reliability health and core error/stall/recovery counters.
- Risks opened:
  - Reliability score formula is heuristic and needs calibration with production traces.
- Metrics snapshot:
  - benchmark_score: 0.5061 (synthetic baseline on 600-scenario suite)
  - feature_checklist_score: 0.6000 (placeholder evaluator)
  - final_score: 0.5343 (synthetic baseline)

  - Use explicit hydrate/merge helpers so restored sessions keep default runtime fields intact.
- Risks opened:
  - End-to-end process-restart validation remains a Q10-04 E2E item.
- Metrics snapshot:
  - benchmark_score: 0.5061 (synthetic baseline on 600-scenario suite)

- Tasks moved to in_progress:
  - Q10-04
- Tasks moved to done:
  - PH2-03
  - R1-06
  - Q10-04
- Blockers:
  - Existing port `5173` was occupied by another local app; reliability E2E validation was executed against local Vite on `:1420`.
- Decisions made:
  - Reliability E2E scenarios now use deterministic Tauri bridge mocking in `addInitScript` to isolate UI reliability behavior from external desktop runtime state.

- Blockers: None.
- Decisions made:
  - Checkpoints now persist an internal dispatch replay payload while public checkpoint/timeline events are sanitized to keep UI payloads compact.
  - Resume path now executes from the latest recoverable checkpoint source and records resumed completion/failure states.
  - Terminal run statuses (`completed`/`cancelled`) now short-circuit with `resume_noop` to avoid duplicate run execution.
- Risks opened:
  - Legacy runs with no checkpoint dispatch payload and attachment-only prompts can only fallback to text replay.
  - Legacy non-v2 message path remains outside managed-run replay guarantees.

- Tasks moved to done:
  - PH8-01
  - S7-01
- Blockers:
  - Permission E2E harness still does not deterministically expose pending-approval UI from mocked bootstrap state (`PH7-04` remains open).
- Decisions made:
  - Replaced plaintext credential store with keychain-first backend.
  - Added encrypted fallback vault (AES-GCM) for keychain-unavailable environments.
  - Added migration path that imports legacy plaintext credentials and deletes migrated plaintext files.
- Risks opened:
  - Fallback vault key derivation currently uses local machine/user context and should be reviewed for stricter enterprise key management requirements.

- Blockers:
  - `PH7-04` still open; policy E2E harness mismatch unresolved.
- Decisions made:
  - Kept auth command interfaces stable and verified all provider/service key operations route through secure credential abstraction.
  - Added startup invocation of credential migration path in Tauri setup to guarantee legacy plaintext cleanup early in app lifecycle.
- Risks opened:

  - Added one-time migration from legacy `secrets.json` into `secrets.vault.json` with plaintext cleanup.
  - Added rotation API in connector secret service and validated revoke/delete behavior post-rotation.
  - Injected sidecar connector secret seed via Rust startup path from secure credential abstraction, with resilient fallback behavior.
- Risks opened:
  - Existing daemon processes started before this change may not receive updated seed env until restart.
  - Sidecar fallback key path remains active when secure seed retrieval fails and should be tracked for enterprise-hardening follow-up.

  - Execute manual runtime smoke on a live session to verify end-user skill tool-selection behavior.

## 2026-02-13 (Implementation Tranche 77)
- Focus: Scheduled-task intent grounding with explicit date/time output rules.
- Tasks moved to in_progress:
  - scheduled-task-temporal-grounding
- Tasks moved to done:
  - scheduled-task-temporal-grounding
- Blockers:
  - None.
- Decisions made:
  - Recurring schedules now default to system IANA timezone when user timezone is omitted.
  - Added a temporal execution contract to every scheduled prompt, including `{{system.now}}` runtime anchor, explicit `YYYY-MM-DD` requirement, and prohibition on relative-only date wording.
  - `schedule_task` responses now include exact schedule metadata (`timezone`, `createdAt`, `nextRunAt`, ISO fields) and explicit next-run timestamp in confirmation text.
- Risks opened:
  - None.
- Metrics snapshot:
  - sidecar_typecheck: pass
  - cron_tool_temporal_tests: pass
- Next actions:
  - Expose created/next run timestamps in the desktop automation card UI for immediate user visibility.

## 2026-02-13 (Implementation Tranche 78)
- Focus: Runtime permission escalation + session-to-automation permission inheritance.
- Tasks moved to in_progress:
  - permission-flow-runtime-escalation
- Tasks moved to done:
  - permission-flow-runtime-escalation
- Blockers:
  - None.
- Decisions made:
  - Removed silent auto-deny behavior for shell commands blocked only by default sandbox scope; those now trigger runtime permission prompts.
  - Preserved hard-deny for explicitly blocked/dangerous shell commands and read-only mode.
  - Added session permission bootstrap encoding/decoding and propagated it into workflow-backed scheduled tasks via `permissionsProfile`.
  - Workflow runs now hydrate isolated execution sessions with inherited permission scopes/cache from the originating session.
  - Persisted session permission scopes/cache in runtime snapshots for reconnect continuity.
  - Standardized denial tool-result copy to `Permission denied` to avoid false implication of explicit user action.
- Risks opened:
  - Session-inherited permission grants are intentionally scoped to task-created workflows; explicit global policy still governs baseline defaults.
- Metrics snapshot:
  - sidecar_typecheck: pass
  - permission_flow_targeted_tests: pass
- Next actions:
  - Surface inherited-permission provenance in automation UI details for auditability.

## 2026-02-13 (Implementation Tranche 79)
- Focus: DeepAgent skill-source initialization hardening for installed skill packs.
- Tasks moved to in_progress:
  - deepagent-installed-skill-source-wiring
- Tasks moved to done:
  - deepagent-installed-skill-source-wiring
- Blockers:
  - None.
- Decisions made:
  - Added `resolveDeepAgentSkillConfig()` in `agent-runner` to derive skill loading config at agent creation.
  - `/skills/` is now passed to DeepAgent whenever either:
    - explicit enabled skill IDs exist, or
    - managed installed skill packs are present on disk.
  - Kept virtual sync scoped to explicit enabled IDs to avoid unnecessary skill-content duplication while still exposing all installed managed skills through backend skill directory discovery.
  - Added regression tests for installed-only activation, sync-ID dedupe, no-skill disable path, and discovery-failure fallback.
- Risks opened:
  - None.
- Metrics snapshot:
  - sidecar_typecheck: pass
  - deepagent_skill_config_tests: pass
- Next actions:
  - Run targeted sidecar tests + typecheck and confirm end-to-end skill loading behavior in a live session.
