# W4-05 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Replaced run list-only panel with run operations console:
  - run timeline stream,
  - event replay slider/playback,
  - node drilldown details,
  - run controls (refresh, pause/resume, cancel).
- Added timeline event detail rendering and payload inspection to reduce failure triage time.
- Added node-attempt detail panel with input/output/error and duration metadata.

## Files Changed

- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src/components/workflow/WorkflowRunPanel.tsx
- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src/stores/workflow-store.ts

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/desktop typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop typecheck passes with new run timeline/drilldown/replay UI.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: timeline + node drilldown + replay controls with fast operator diagnosis path.
- Result: implemented in `WorkflowRunPanel` with event replay controls and node-level debugging surfaces.

## Residual Risks

- Time-to-diagnose <=2 minutes requires E2E/usability timing validation and is not fully benchmarked yet.

## Rollback Path

- Revert `WorkflowRunPanel.tsx` and corresponding store stream/replay APIs.
