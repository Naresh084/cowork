# PH2-02 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Delivered structured provider error taxonomy for the runtime provider path (Gemini integration).
- Added typed mapping from provider failure classes to retry-aware error semantics.
- Added fixture-driven accuracy gate to prevent regressions in classification logic.

## Files Changed

- packages/providers/src/gemini/gemini-provider.ts
- apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/providers/gemini-provider.taxonomy.test.ts

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/sidecar test -- src/providers/gemini-provider.taxonomy.test.ts
pnpm --filter @cowork/providers typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Taxonomy tests pass with `>= 98%` fixture-mapping gate.
- Providers package typecheck passes.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Implement structured provider error taxonomy.
- Result: Completed for Gemini provider path with tested taxonomy + retry hints.

## Residual Risks

- Additional provider backends still need equivalent taxonomy hardening in later phases.

## Rollback Path

- Revert Gemini taxonomy integration and fixture tests.
