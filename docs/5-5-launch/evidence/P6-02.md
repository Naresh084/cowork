# P6-02 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Added inline pending-approval queue summary and jump actions to chat message timeline:
  - `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src/components/chat/MessageList.tsx`
- Added:
  - sorted pending list (chronological),
  - sticky queue summary card with counts/risk visibility,
  - jump controls (`Prev Pending`, `Next Pending`, direct chip jump),
  - permission-card ref mapping + scroll targeting.

## Files Changed

- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src/components/chat/MessageList.tsx`

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/shared build
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/desktop typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Shared build and desktop typecheck pass with new summary/jump logic.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: chronological resolution path.
- Current result: users can jump to pending approvals in timestamp order from inline chat summary controls.

## Residual Risks

- Additional UX telemetry/usability validation for high-volume pending queues remains open.

## Rollback Path

- Remove pending summary card and permission ref-based jump wiring; keep existing inline permission cards only.
