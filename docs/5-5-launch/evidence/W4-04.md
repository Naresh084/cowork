# W4-04 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Expanded workflow builder with curated pack templates and one-click draft creation flow.
- Added template-driven trigger scaffolding (manual + chat, optional schedule) with balanced retry defaults.
- Expanded workflow inspector with trigger diagnostics:
  - confidence evaluation,
  - threshold control,
  - explainable reason codes,
  - optional "evaluate + run top match" action.

## Files Changed

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/desktop typecheck
pnpm --filter @cowork/sidecar typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop typecheck passes.
- Sidecar typecheck passes.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: workflow builder/inspector expansion for pack templates and trigger diagnostics.
- Result: implemented with template creation and diagnostics/evaluation controls in inspector.

## Residual Risks

- Usability benchmark proving >=90% workflow creation completion is pending dedicated UX study instrumentation.

## Rollback Path

- Revert template blocks and diagnostics panels in workflow builder/inspector and remove store command wiring.
