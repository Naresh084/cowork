# RB5-06 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Upgraded tool execution cards for research/browser deep-tool readability in:
  - `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src/components/chat/ToolExecutionCard.tsx`
- Added dedicated result renderers:
  - `ResearchResultView` for evidence totals, confidence quality, top ranked sources, and partial/resume cues.
  - `BrowserRunResultView` for action replay, blocked-reason explanation, checkpoint recovery path, and final URL.
- Added extraction helpers to normalize result payloads before rendering to reduce user-facing ambiguity.

## Files Changed

- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src/components/chat/ToolExecutionCard.tsx

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/desktop typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop typecheck passes with new specialized tool-result surfaces.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: compact action replay + failure explanations so deep-tool outcomes are self-explanatory.
- Current result: implemented for research/browser tool outputs.

## Residual Risks

- Additional usability testing is still needed to quantify comprehension gains for non-expert users.

## Rollback Path

- Revert specialized research/browser renderers and fall back to raw JSON result blocks.
