# O9-03 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Added deterministic benchmark runner with seeded scenario scoring.
- Added suite registry and run output scorecard model.
- Integrated run result persistence path through benchmark repository.

## Files Changed

- apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/benchmark/runner.ts
- apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/benchmark/suites/index.ts
- apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/benchmark/suites/twin-track-core.ts
- packages/storage/src/repositories/benchmark.ts
- apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/agent-runner.ts

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/storage typecheck
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/sidecar typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Benchmark runner and persistence integration typecheck successfully.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Deterministic benchmark executor with seeded scenarios.
- Result: Implemented and wired into runtime command path.

## Residual Risks

- Determinism tolerance and large-suite runtime performance need dedicated benchmark tests.

## Rollback Path

- Revert benchmark runner integration and benchmark repository writes.
