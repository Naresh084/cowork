# B3-08 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Added dedicated branch E2E suite:
  - `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/e2e/branching.spec.ts`
- Covered full chat-level branch lifecycle flows:
  1. create branch from branch panel,
  2. merge non-active branch into active branch.
- Added deterministic desktop/Tauri mock harness for branch command paths.

## Files Changed

- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/e2e/branching.spec.ts

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/desktop typecheck
pnpm playwright test e2e/branching.spec.ts --project=chromium --config playwright.reliability.local.config.ts
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Branch E2E suite passes (`2/2`).
- Desktop typecheck passes.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: end-to-end branch create/merge scenario passes in CI.
- Result: met locally with deterministic branch E2E scenarios.

## Residual Risks

- CI matrix rollout for this spec still needs workflow integration confirmation.

## Rollback Path

- Remove `branching.spec.ts` and related branch E2E mocks.
