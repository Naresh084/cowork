# PH7-03 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Completed enterprise policy profile settings UI and preview coverage:
  - enterprise profiles were already introduced in policy contracts and selectors (`enterprise_balanced`, `enterprise_strict`),
  - added settings panel that previews profile impact before apply:
    - `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src/components/settings/ToolPolicySettings.tsx`
  - integrated panel into capabilities settings:
    - `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src/components/settings/CapabilitySettings.tsx`

## Files Changed

- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src/components/settings/ToolPolicySettings.tsx`
- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src/components/settings/CapabilitySettings.tsx`

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/shared build
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/desktop typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Build/typecheck passes for enterprise profile selection and impact preview surfaces.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: enterprise policy profiles + settings UI.
- Current result: enterprise profiles are selectable in settings with explicit before/after impact preview and guarded apply flow.

## Residual Risks

- Policy impact preview is profile-definition based and does not yet include full runtime-conditional rule simulation.

## Rollback Path

- Remove new profile preview editor and keep legacy capability policy controls only.
