# PH8-03 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Completed month-8 signed-pack validation milestone for managed connector/skill packs.
- Added signature generation during managed install/create flows.
- Added signature verification during managed discovery to block unsigned or tampered packs by default.

## Files Changed

- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/connectors/connector-service.ts`
- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/skill-service.ts`
- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/connectors/connector-service.security.test.ts`
- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/skill-service.security.test.ts`

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/sidecar exec vitest run --config vitest.config.ts src/connectors/connector-service.security.test.ts src/skill-service.security.test.ts src/connectors/secret-service.test.ts
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/sidecar typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Signature validation tests passed for connector and skill managed packs.
- Managed install flows now emit `SIGNATURE.json` and remain discoverable.
- Unsigned managed packs are skipped by discovery.
- Sidecar typecheck passed.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: signed pack validation for connector/skill/workflow ecosystem.
- Current result: connector and skill pack validation is enforced for managed packs; unsigned/tampered managed packs are blocked.

## Residual Risks

- Workflow-pack signature enforcement path remains to be integrated in workflow pack registry/distribution path.

## Rollback Path

- Remove managed-pack signature checks in service discovery paths and remove signature write during install/create.
