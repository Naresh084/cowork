# O9-02 Evidence

## Change Summary
- Added frontend typed event definitions/parsers/subscriptions for benchmark and release-gate envelopes.

## Files Changed
- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src/lib/event-types.ts
- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src/lib/agent-events.ts
- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/types.ts

## Verification Commands
```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/desktop typecheck
pnpm --filter @cowork/sidecar typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary
- Desktop and sidecar typechecks pass with new event contracts.

## Acceptance Mapping
- Plan acceptance criteria: strict typed benchmark/release-gate event handling in frontend.
- Result: satisfied.

## Residual Risks
- UI panels for benchmark/release gate are still pending O9-05/O9-06.

## Rollback Path
- Revert event union and parser additions.
