# PH6-04 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Completed month-6 deep-tool explanation scope via tool card upgrades:
  - `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src/components/chat/ToolExecutionCard.tsx`
- Added:
  - research execution explainability (evidence ranking/confidence summary/resume cues),
  - browser execution explainability (action replay + blocked reason + checkpoint recovery guidance),
  - compact structured presentation replacing raw-only payload interpretation.

## Files Changed

- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src/components/chat/ToolExecutionCard.tsx

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/desktop typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop typecheck passes.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: tool cards explain deep-tool failures and recovery paths.
- Current result: implemented for research/browser tool families.

## Residual Risks

- Quantitative UX satisfaction validation remains pending in month-9 usability pass.

## Rollback Path

- Revert specialized deep-tool result cards and keep baseline generic result rendering.
