# PH5-02 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Completed adaptive trigger confidence + explainability milestone by delivering:
  - adaptive scoring model,
  - trigger explainability diagnostics,
  - service + IPC evaluation surfaces,
  - seeded false-positive quality gate.
- Workstream closure:
  - `W4-03` delivered and validated.

## Linked Evidence

- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/docs/5-5-launch/evidence/W4-03.md`

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/sidecar test -- src/workflow/trigger-router.test.ts src/workflow/trigger-router.quality.test.ts
pnpm --filter @cowork/sidecar typecheck
pnpm --filter @cowork/desktop typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Trigger behavior tests pass (`3/3`).
- Trigger quality gate test passes (`false-positive rate < 3%` on seeded corpus).
- Sidecar and desktop typecheck pass.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Month target acceptance: adaptive trigger confidence + explainability.
- Result: met.

## Residual Risks

- Production corpus calibration should continue as benchmark suites expand.

## Rollback Path

- Revert adaptive trigger scoring and evaluation command paths.
