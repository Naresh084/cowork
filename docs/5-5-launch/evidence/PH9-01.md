# PH9-01 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Implemented core profile UX path for month-9 onboarding/settings work:
  - persisted `simple`/`pro` profile setting,
  - settings profile switch,
  - profile-based settings tab surfacing,
  - onboarding mapping to profile mode,
  - onboarding environment health checks and recommended defaults action.

## Files Changed

- apps/desktop/src/stores/settings-store.ts
- apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SettingsView.tsx
- apps/desktop/src/components/onboarding/Onboarding.tsx

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/desktop typecheck
pnpm --filter @cowork/sidecar typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop and sidecar typecheck pass with profile-mode and onboarding preflight changes.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Complete simple onboarding + pro mode profile UX.
- Result: Done.

## Residual Risks

- First-success timing target requires dedicated usability benchmark pass in later validation tasks.

## Rollback Path

- Revert settings profile switch and onboarding profile mapping.
