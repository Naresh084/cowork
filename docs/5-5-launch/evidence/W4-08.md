# W4-08 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Added explicit skill lifecycle and trust metadata schema:
  - lifecycle states: `draft`, `verified`, `published`, `deprecated`.
  - trust levels: `unverified`, `community`, `verified`, `official`.
- Extended skill metadata transport through Rust command DTOs so lifecycle/trust fields are preserved to frontend.
- Added skill-store lifecycle/trust derivation with explicit metadata precedence and source-based fallback heuristics.
- Added lifecycle/trust badges and provenance visibility across skills UI:
  - marketplace cards,
  - installed skills list,
  - skill details panel.
- Added default lifecycle/trust metadata for user-created custom skills (`draft` + `unverified`) at creation time.

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/shared build
pnpm --filter @cowork/desktop typecheck
pnpm --filter @cowork/sidecar typecheck
cd apps/desktop/src-tauri && cargo check
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Shared package builds successfully.
- Desktop and sidecar typechecks pass.
- Rust `cargo check` passes after command type updates.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: skill lifecycle visibility before install/use.
- Result: lifecycle + trust signals are visible in card, installed list, and details panel before enable/install decisions.

## Residual Risks

- Lifecycle/trust inference for skills missing explicit metadata is heuristic and should be calibrated with marketplace policy rules.

## Rollback Path

- Revert skill metadata schema additions and remove UI/store lifecycle badge wiring.
