# PH5-01 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Completed month-5 phase task for deterministic workflow recovery depth by delivering:
  - deterministic resume checkpoints,
  - replay-safe node progression,
  - node-level compensation hooks on retry.
- Workstream tasks closed under this phase:
  - `W4-01` (deterministic resume + compensation hooks)
  - `W4-02` (retry profile policy contracts)

- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/docs/5-5-launch/evidence/W4-02.md`

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/shared build
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/sidecar test -- src/workflow/engine.resume.test.ts src/workflow/retry-policy.profile.test.ts
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/sidecar typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Workflow engine deterministic resume tests pass.
- Retry profile contract tests pass.
- Sidecar typecheck passes with profile wiring and checkpoint logic.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Month target acceptance: deterministic workflow resume + compensation hooks.
- Result: met.

## Residual Risks

- Trigger intelligence and workflow timeline UX are still open under `PH5-02` to `PH5-04`.

## Rollback Path

- Revert workflow engine runtime checkpoint/compensation changes.
- Revert retry-profile resolver integration and tests.
