# O9-07 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Extended runtime benchmark and release-gate command behavior to persist and reload gate state.
- Retained Rust command wrappers for benchmark run and release-gate status.

## Files Changed

- apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/agent-runner.ts
- apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/agent.rs
- apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/desktop typecheck
cargo check
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop TypeScript and Tauri Rust command surfaces compile successfully.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Frontend can trigger and poll benchmark runs / release gate status.
- Result: Command path exists and returns persisted status.

## Residual Risks

- Frontend benchmark dashboard panels are not implemented yet.

## Rollback Path

- Revert benchmark/release-gate command handlers to pre-persistence behavior.
