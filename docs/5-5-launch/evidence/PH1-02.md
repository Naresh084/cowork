# PH1-02 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Frozen v2 command/type/event contracts in a dedicated source-of-truth document:
  - `docs/5-5-launch/contracts/v2-contract-freeze.md`
- Captured:
  - Tauri command contract list,
  - sidecar IPC contract list,
  - event contract list,
  - shared type contract list,
  - naming policy and compatibility/change-control rules.

## Files Changed

- docs/5-5-launch/contracts/v2-contract-freeze.md

## Verification Commands

```bash
rg -n "Tauri Command Contract|Sidecar IPC Contract|Event Contract|Type Contract|Compatibility Policy" docs/5-5-launch/contracts/v2-contract-freeze.md
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Contract freeze file includes all required v2 interface categories and compatibility constraints.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Freeze command/type/event contracts for v2 interfaces.
- Result: Done.

## Residual Risks

- Future external-provider changes can force additive extensions; breaking changes still require explicit gate exception.

## Rollback Path

- Revert `v2-contract-freeze.md` and restore prior contract state tracking.
