- packages/storage/src/repositories/memory-query.ts
- packages/storage/test/memory-repositories.test.ts
- packages/storage/package.json

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/storage test
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/storage typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Storage memory repository integration tests pass.
- Storage typecheck passes with test harness and repository contracts.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Result: Done.

## Residual Risks

- Benchmarks and soak tests for very large memory corpora remain in later phases.

## Rollback Path

- Revert storage repository tests and related package script updates.
