# Q10-05 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Added deterministic Playwright memory E2E coverage for:
  - memory create/update/delete lifecycle,
  - deep retrieval with conflict diagnostics,
  - feedback loop impact on subsequent retrieval ranking.
- Implemented a stable desktop mock harness for memory commands with in-memory state mutation and scoring deltas driven by feedback actions.
- Hardened the E2E harness readiness path to avoid mock deadlocks before invoking command flows.

## Files Changed

- apps/desktop/e2e/memory.spec.ts

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/desktop exec playwright test e2e/memory.spec.ts --project=chromium --config=playwright.reliability.local.config.ts
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/desktop typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Playwright result: `3 passed`.
- Typecheck result: pass (`tsc --noEmit`).

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: memory E2E validates create/retrieve/conflict/feedback lifecycle.
- Result: Completed. The suite now enforces memory CRUD behavior, evidence/conflict diagnostics, and feedback-driven rank adjustments.

## Residual Risks

- Current E2E uses deterministic mock command behavior for stability; periodic runs against full sidecar-backed memory commands remain necessary for full production parity.
