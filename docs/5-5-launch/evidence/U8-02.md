# U8-02 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Added persisted UX profile setting (`simple`/`pro`) in settings store.
- Added profile switch control in settings header.
- Implemented profile-based capability surfacing: simple mode hides advanced settings tabs, pro mode shows full configuration surface.
- Wired onboarding completion to set UX profile based on setup path (`fast` -> `simple`, `deep` -> `pro`).

## Files Changed

- apps/desktop/src/stores/settings-store.ts
- apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SettingsView.tsx
- apps/desktop/src/components/onboarding/Onboarding.tsx

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/desktop typecheck
pnpm --filter @cowork/sidecar typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop and sidecar typecheck pass with the profile switch and tab surfacing changes.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Add settings profile switch (`simple`/`pro`) and capability surfacing by profile.
- Result: Done.

## Residual Risks

- Simple-mode curation is currently tab-level; deeper per-control progressive disclosure remains a follow-up for UX polish.

## Rollback Path

- Remove `uxProfile` setting and restore full tab list in settings view.
