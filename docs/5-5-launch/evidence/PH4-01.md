# PH4-01 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Branch schema + API baseline completed across storage and command layers:
  - branch/merge persistence repositories are in place,
  - sidecar branch create/merge handlers are wired,
  - Rust command wrappers now return typed branch payloads.

## Files Changed (this tranche)

- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/agent.rs

## Verification Commands

```bash
cd /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src-tauri
cargo check
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Cargo check passes with typed branch command contracts.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: complete branch schema and APIs.
- Result: met for backend/runtime APIs. Branch UI/UX and runtime isolation depth continue in `PH4-02` and later branch tasks.

## Residual Risks

- Branch API adoption in frontend workflows remains a follow-on integration track.

## Rollback Path

- Revert typed Rust branch command wrappers and fallback to untyped value payloads.
