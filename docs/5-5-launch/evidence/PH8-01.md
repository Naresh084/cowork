# PH8-01 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Completed month-8 credential hardening milestone by replacing plaintext credential storage with secure abstraction:
  - keychain-first backend for normal operation,
  - encrypted vault fallback for keychain-unavailable paths,
  - one-way plaintext migration cleanup.

## Files Changed

- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/credentials.rs`
- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.lock`

## Verification Commands

```bash
cargo check
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Rust build and dependency graph resolve successfully with the new secure credential backend.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: replace plaintext credentials with keychain abstraction.
- Current result: plaintext JSON store is migrated and removed; active credential operations no longer persist plaintext at rest.

## Residual Risks

- Downstream UI posture/audit visibility work remains (`S7-05`).

## Rollback Path

- Restore legacy plaintext credential storage module and remove secure backend dependencies.
