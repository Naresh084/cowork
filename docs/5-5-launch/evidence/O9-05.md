# O9-05 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Added benchmark dashboard UI with:
  - suite trigger action (`Run Core Suite`),
  - latest benchmark/feature/final score cards,
  - active run progress status,
  - per-dimension scorecard rendering,
  - embedded release gate panel.
- Added benchmark Zustand store to hold run progress, scorecard state, release-gate state, and invoke Tauri benchmark/gate commands.
- Added persisted score trend history (`scoreHistory`) with de-duplication by run ID and bounded retention.
- Added trend visualization section with timestamped final-score movement and delta from previous snapshot.
- Added dedicated Settings tab (`benchmarks`) and wired dashboard entry in settings navigation/content router.

## Files Changed

- apps/desktop/src/components/benchmark/BenchmarkDashboard.tsx
- apps/desktop/src/components/benchmark/ReleaseGatePanel.tsx
- apps/desktop/src/stores/benchmark-store.ts
- apps/desktop/src/stores/app-store.ts
- apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SettingsView.tsx
- apps/desktop/src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/desktop typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop TypeScript compile passes with benchmark dashboard, trend history, and settings tab integration.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Build benchmark dashboard scorecard + trends.
- Result: Implemented. Dashboard scorecards + historical trend visibility are available in-app.

## Residual Risks

- Trend data quality depends on benchmark run cadence and scorecard completeness.

## Rollback Path

- Revert benchmark tab wiring and benchmark dashboard/store trend additions.
