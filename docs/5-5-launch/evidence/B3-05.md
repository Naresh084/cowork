# B3-05 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Added in-chat branch control surface via `BranchGraphPanel`.
- Integrated branch panel into chat view directly beneath session header.
- Implemented branch create and merge controls without leaving chat context.

## Files Changed

- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src/components/chat/BranchGraphPanel.tsx
- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src/components/chat/ChatView.tsx
- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src/stores/session-store.ts

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/desktop typecheck
pnpm playwright test e2e/branching.spec.ts --project=chromium --config playwright.reliability.local.config.ts
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop typecheck passes.
- Branch create/merge E2E scenarios pass (`2/2`).

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: users can create/merge branches in chat.
- Result: met.

## Residual Risks

- Branch graph visualization remains intentionally compact; advanced visualization is a future enhancement.

## Rollback Path

- Remove `BranchGraphPanel` from chat view and revert branch action wiring in session store.
