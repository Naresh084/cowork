# PH6-01 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Month-6 deep-research resilience workstream completed for the committed scope.
- Delivered under `RB5-01` + `RB5-02`:
  - resilient polling and retry budgeting,
  - partial result handling with resume token continuation,
  - cancellation support with best-effort interaction cancel,
  - evidence normalization/ranking with confidence scoring and provenance,
  - structured research evidence events for UI consumption.

## Files Changed

- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/packages/providers/src/gemini/deep-research.ts
- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/tools/research-tools.ts
- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/tools/research-tools.test.ts

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/providers build
pnpm --filter @cowork/sidecar typecheck
pnpm --filter @cowork/sidecar test -- src/tools/research-tools.test.ts
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Build/typecheck/tests pass for deep-research hardening scope.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: deep research resilient polling + partial results.
- Current result: implementation complete and test-validated at unit level.

## Residual Risks

- Formal reliability threshold proof is pending benchmark/failure-injection run.

## Rollback Path

- Revert deep research provider and sidecar research tool changes.
