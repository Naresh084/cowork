- ADR includes:
  - frozen component topology,
  - frozen end-to-end run sequence,
  - frozen memory lifecycle loop,
  - compatibility and change-control consequences.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Freeze target architecture and flow diagrams in engineering ADR.
- Result: Done.
