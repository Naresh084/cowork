# B3-01 Evidence

## Change Summary
- Added branch session/merge result shared schemas for cross-layer serialization.

## Files Changed
- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/packages/shared/src/types/branch.ts
- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/packages/shared/src/types/index.ts

## Verification Commands
```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/shared typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary
- Shared types compile with branch contracts exported.

## Acceptance Mapping
- Plan acceptance criteria: branch/merge types available for Rust/Node/UI alignment.
- Result: satisfied.

## Residual Risks
- Full branch persistence and conflict UX still pending B3-02..B3-08.

## Rollback Path
- Remove `branch.ts` and shared exports.
