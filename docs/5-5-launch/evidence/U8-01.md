# U8-01 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Completed the 4-step fast onboarding path with explicit environment health checks and defaults.
- Added onboarding preflight checks for runtime readiness, provider credentials, model selection, fallback search key readiness, media defaults, sandbox safety, and default workspace.
- Added a one-click `Apply Defaults` action in onboarding review to quickly reset to recommended baseline values.
- Added completion gating on blocking preflight failures.

## Files Changed

- apps/desktop/src/components/onboarding/Onboarding.tsx

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/desktop typecheck
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/sidecar typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop and sidecar typecheck pass with onboarding health-check logic and completion gating.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Build 4-step onboarding with environment health checks and defaults.
- Result: Done.

## Residual Risks

- Time-to-first-success KPI (<= 3 minutes) still needs usability study confirmation.

## Rollback Path

- Revert onboarding preflight and defaults sections in `Onboarding.tsx`.
