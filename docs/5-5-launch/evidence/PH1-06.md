# PH1-06 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Added benchmark runner scaffolding with deterministic seeded scoring.
- Added initial Twin-Track comparable suite definitions.
- Wired benchmark execution path into sidecar runtime and persistence.

## Files Changed

- apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/benchmark/runner.ts
- apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/benchmark/suites/twin-track-core.ts
- apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/benchmark/suites/index.ts
- apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/agent-runner.ts

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/sidecar typecheck
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/storage typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Sidecar and storage typecheck pass after benchmark scaffolding integration.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Add benchmark runner/suite scaffolds.
- Result: Completed scaffold with deterministic suite execution path and runtime wiring.

## Residual Risks

- Scenario count and realism are still below the final 600-scenario target.

## Rollback Path

- Revert benchmark module additions and `agent-runner.ts` benchmark integration.
