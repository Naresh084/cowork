# PH5-04 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Month-5 workflow timeline expansion milestone completed by delivering:
  - `W4-05` timeline/drilldown/replay UI depth,
  - `W4-06` live run event buffering + schedule health state.

## Files Changed

- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src/components/workflow/WorkflowRunPanel.tsx
- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src/stores/workflow-store.ts

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/desktop typecheck
pnpm --filter @cowork/sidecar typecheck
pnpm --filter @cowork/sidecar test -- src/workflow/trigger-router.test.ts src/workflow/trigger-router.quality.test.ts src/tools/workflow-tool.test.ts
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop typecheck passes.
- Sidecar typecheck passes.
- Targeted workflow tool/trigger suites pass (7 tests across 3 files).

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: expanded workflow run timeline depth with actionable operator surfaces.
- Result: completed with replay controls, node drilldown, and live progression state.

## Residual Risks

- End-to-end workflow reliability benchmark (`Q10-06`) is still pending.

## Rollback Path

- Revert run timeline/store live-streaming changes and restore previous run list panel behavior.
