# PH9-03 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Completed month-9 artifact resilience milestone by shipping preview hardening:
  - runtime preview error boundary with safe fallback UI,
  - lazy virtualized rendering for very large code/text artifacts.
- This protects panel responsiveness and avoids full-tree render stalls on large artifact previews.

## Files Changed

- apps/desktop/src/components/panels/PreviewPanel.tsx

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/desktop typecheck
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/sidecar typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop and sidecar typechecks pass with artifact-preview resilience changes.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Artifact virtualization + preview boundaries.
- Result: Done.

## Residual Risks

- Spreadsheet-heavy rendering remains a candidate for additional row-windowing if large sheet traces regress responsiveness.

## Rollback Path

- Revert `PreviewPanel.tsx` virtualization and error-boundary additions.
