# PH9-02 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Completed month-9 unified run timeline UX scope by closing:
  - `U8-03` persistent run-status rail with recovery and branch context
  - `U8-04` unified turn timeline grouping across stream/tool/permission/memory events
- Unified in-chat operational visibility now includes:
  - continuous run state and actions (stop/recover/review approvals),
  - branch context pill,
  - memory lifecycle event rows inside the same turn activity flow.

## Files Changed

- apps/desktop/src/components/chat/ChatView.tsx
- apps/desktop/src/hooks/useAgentEvents.ts
- apps/desktop/src/stores/chat-store.ts
- apps/desktop/src/components/chat/MessageList.tsx
- apps/desktop/src/stores/chat-store.test.ts

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/desktop typecheck
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/sidecar typecheck
cd apps/desktop && pnpm vitest --run src/stores/chat-store.test.ts
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop and sidecar compile cleanly with unified timeline/run-status changes.
- Chat store tests pass, including memory activity derivation test.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Complete unified run timeline UX.
- Result: Done.

## Residual Risks

- Additional timeline detail expansion (payload-level inspector for memory events and richer keyboard focus behavior for approval jumps) remains non-blocking follow-up polish.

## Rollback Path

- Revert `U8-03` and `U8-04` file set changes to restore prior header + stall-banner + timeline behavior.
