# DB-07 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Added migration report retrieval in memory service and sidecar/Tauri command path.
- Surfaced migration diagnostics in runtime settings for active workspace.

## Files Changed

- apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/memory/memory-service.ts
- apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/ipc-handler.ts
- apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/types.ts
- apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/deep.rs
- apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs
- apps/desktop/src/components/settings/RuntimeSettings.tsx

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/desktop typecheck
pnpm --filter @cowork/sidecar typecheck
cd apps/desktop/src-tauri && cargo check
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop and sidecar typecheck pass with new diagnostics UI and IPC types.
- Tauri command layer compiles with `deep_memory_get_migration_report` command registered.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Generate migration report and surface in settings diagnostics.
- Result: Done.

## Residual Risks

- Diagnostics are shown per active workspace; no aggregate multi-project dashboard yet.

## Rollback Path

- Remove migration report command and runtime diagnostics section.
