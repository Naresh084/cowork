# PH3-04 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Completed memory inspector alpha UI delivery:
  - selected memory inspection panel,
  - evidence query controls,
  - ranking/explanation display,
  - feedback submission actions,
  - in-place edit/save/cancel and delete controls for selected memory.

## Files Changed

- apps/desktop/src/components/memory/MemoryInspector.tsx
- apps/desktop/src/components/memory/MemoryPanel.tsx
- apps/desktop/src/components/memory/index.ts

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/desktop typecheck
pnpm --filter @cowork/desktop test -- src/stores/memory-store.test.ts
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop typecheck passes with new inspector alpha components.
- Memory store tests pass (`3/3`).

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Deliver memory inspector alpha UI.
- Result: Completed. Alpha inspector is integrated and supports evidence viewing + core control actions.

## Residual Risks

- Inspector coverage should be expanded with dedicated component/E2E tests.

## Rollback Path

- Revert memory inspector alpha component and panel wiring.
