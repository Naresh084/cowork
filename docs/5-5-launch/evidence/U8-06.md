# U8-06 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Added artifact search and pagination controls to `WorkingFolderSection` for long session histories.
- Added searchable fields across artifact `path`, filename, and artifact type.
- Added paginated rendering (page size: 60) with prev/next controls and page counters.
- Added filtered empty-state feedback when no artifacts match the active query.

## Files Changed

- apps/desktop/src/components/panels/WorkingFolderSection.tsx

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/desktop typecheck
pnpm --filter @cowork/sidecar typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop and sidecar typechecks pass with artifact list search/pagination updates.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Scalable artifact navigation.
- Result: Done.

## Residual Risks

- Current pagination is client-side over loaded artifacts. If artifact volume grows significantly further, store-level cursor pagination remains a future optimization.

## Rollback Path

- Revert search/pagination controls in `WorkingFolderSection.tsx` and restore full-list rendering.
