# S7-05 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Added a user-facing security posture panel in settings with clear migration and storage status reporting.
- Added a Rust auth command to provide current security posture signals to the UI.

## Files Changed

- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src/components/settings/SecuritySettings.tsx`
- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src/components/settings/RuntimeSettings.tsx`
- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/auth.rs`
- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs`

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/desktop typecheck
cargo check
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Desktop typecheck passed with the new settings panel and invoke contract.
- Rust compile check passed with the new `auth_get_security_posture` command registration.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: user can clearly see credential migration and security state.
- Current result: settings panel surfaces credential backend state, secure seed status, plaintext residue detection, connector vault state, and audit log presence/size.

## Residual Risks

- Audit log depth is currently summarized as presence/size only; event-level drilldown remains open under `S7-08`.

## Rollback Path

- Remove `SecuritySettings` panel and `auth_get_security_posture` command, reverting Runtime settings to prior structure.
