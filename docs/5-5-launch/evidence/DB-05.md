# DB-05 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Verified import of legacy `GEMINI.md` into `instructions` memory atom with provenance tag path.
- Added migration test assertion for `legacy_gemini_md` tagged memory import.

## Files Changed

- apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/memory/memory-service.ts
- apps/desktop/src-sidecar/src/memory/memory-service.migration.test.ts

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @cowork/sidecar test -- src/memory/memory-service.migration.test.ts
pnpm --filter @cowork/sidecar typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Migration test confirms `GEMINI.md` content imports once as an instruction memory entry.
- Sidecar typecheck passes.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Import legacy `GEMINI.md` as `instructions` memory atoms with `legacy_gemini_md` provenance.
- Result: Done.

## Residual Risks

- Re-import is intentionally blocked after first successful migration to prevent duplication.

## Rollback Path

- Remove legacy `GEMINI.md` importer block in memory service.
