## Change Summary
- Added portable benchmark schema contracts and release-gate status types.

## Files Changed
- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/packages/shared/src/types/benchmark.ts
- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/geminicowork/packages/shared/src/types/index.ts

## Verification Commands
```bash
pnpm --filter @gemini-cowork/shared typecheck
```

## Verification Output Summary
- Benchmark types compile and are exported.

## Acceptance Mapping
- Plan acceptance criteria: typed benchmark artifacts for portability and UI/runner exchange.

## Residual Risks
- Full benchmark runner implementation remains in O9-03/O9-04.

## Rollback Path
- Remove `benchmark.ts` and corresponding exports.
