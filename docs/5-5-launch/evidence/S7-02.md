# S7-02 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Verified and enforced provider/auth key operations through the secure credential abstraction:
  - `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/auth.rs`
- Provider and service-specific key APIs all route through:
  - `credentials::credentials_get(...)`
  - `credentials::credentials_set(...)`
  - `credentials::credentials_delete(...)`
- This now inherits the keychain-first + encrypted fallback behavior implemented in `credentials.rs`.

## Files Changed

- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/auth.rs` (verified command routing)
- `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/credentials.rs`

## Verification Commands

```bash
cargo check
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Rust compilation passes with auth command routing against the secure credential backend.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: existing auth APIs remain backward compatible while using secure credential abstraction.
- Current result: auth/provider key commands continue using the same command interface, now backed by secure credential storage.

## Residual Risks

- End-to-end UI-level credential migration indicator remains pending (`S7-05`).

## Rollback Path

- Point auth command handlers back to legacy plaintext credential store implementation.
