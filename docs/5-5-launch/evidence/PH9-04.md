# PH9-04 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Delivered internal usability-study execution kit to operationalize month-9 iteration loop:
  - study plan with cadence, participant mix, rubric, and flow requirements,
  - per-session capture template,
  - findings log template,
  - batch scorecard CSV template.
- Standardized severity model (`P0-P3`) and direct linkage from findings to implementation task IDs.

## Files Changed

- docs/5-5-launch/usability/study-plan.md
- docs/5-5-launch/usability/session-template.md
- docs/5-5-launch/usability/findings-log.md
- docs/5-5-launch/usability/scorecard-template.csv

## Verification Commands

```bash
rg -n "Flow-1|Flow-2|Flow-3|Flow-4|Flow-5|overall_satisfaction|linked_task_ids" docs/5-5-launch/usability/*
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Usability kit files include all target flows, scoring fields, and task-linking hooks required for iterative month-9 reviews.

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: Internal usability studies + iteration.
- Result: Done (process and artifacts now in-repo and ready for recurring execution).

## Residual Risks

- This milestone establishes the process; ongoing study execution quality depends on weekly adherence and participant availability.

## Rollback Path

- Remove `docs/5-5-launch/usability/*` and restore prior month-9 process tracking.
