# PH4-04 Evidence

## Change Summary

- Reliability/resume E2E coverage completed with dedicated suites:
  - `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/e2e/reliability.spec.ts`
  - `/Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/e2e/branching.spec.ts`
- Reliability suite validates stalled-run recovery, permission persistence across reload, and queued message continuity.
- Branching suite validates create/merge flows and cached active-branch switch latency behavior.

## Files Changed

- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/e2e/reliability.spec.ts
- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/e2e/branching.spec.ts
- /Users/naresh/Work/Personal/cowork/apps/desktop/playwright.reliability.local.config.ts

## Verification Commands

```bash
pnpm playwright test e2e/reliability.spec.ts --project=chromium --config playwright.reliability.local.config.ts
pnpm playwright test e2e/branching.spec.ts --project=chromium --config playwright.reliability.local.config.ts
```

## Verification Output Summary

- Reliability suite passes (`3/3`).
- Branching suite passes (`3/3`).

## Acceptance Mapping

- Plan acceptance criteria: finish reliability/resume E2E suite.
- Result: met.

## Residual Risks

- CI workflow enforcement for both suites should be completed to guarantee gate behavior on every PR.

## Rollback Path

- Remove newly added E2E suites and revert to prior baseline test set.
