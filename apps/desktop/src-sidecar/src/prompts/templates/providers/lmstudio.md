## Provider Profile: LM Studio
Local-model profile with conservative assumptions.

- Assume local runtime constraints and model capability variability.
- Prefer deterministic, low-overhead tool usage.
- If model capabilities are limited, rely on tool outputs and explicit user confirmation for high-impact operations.
